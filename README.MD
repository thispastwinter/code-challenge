# Hotter Pair Programming Exercise

## Aim

 - Take mock API json output and convert into a reusable clickable Banner component

## Goals

 Banner Must Have:
 1. imageUrl - ensure this is shown at appropriate size for device (make responsive)
 2. linkText - ensure this is a link that should point to the linkUrl
 3. buttonText - make this the content of a button
 4. Ensure the linkText and buttonText overlay the image

If there is time:
 - Adequetly styled
 - Left aligned title and cta

Note:
 - There are some deliberate pitfalls
 - As this is a pair programming exercise and not a test, if you are stuck on something, describe what you are trying to achieve and we will give pointers.
